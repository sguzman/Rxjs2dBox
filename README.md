# Rxjs2dBox
Move a box around with arrow keys - made completely using Rxjs for statement management

### Summary
I wanted to build a small HTML5 canvas app that moves a square around like one of my previous repos. But the goal here 
was to use as many observables as possible.

#### Why
I recently discovered RxJS and once the concept hit, it really left an impression on me. Obviously, I hope the reader realized
that this is a very contrived example. No one should strive to use Observables wherever possible.
